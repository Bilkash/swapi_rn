This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using:

- [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- typescript
- redux
- react-redux
- @reduxjs/toolkit
- @react-navigation

## For local start

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

```bash
# using npm
npm start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios
```

Now I don`t have any Apple device for testing this app on IOS.
